# AI-Powered Emotional Music Companion

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

It is an innovative project that leverages the emotional power of music to enhance mental well-being. It offers a personalized AI companion that curates music playlists tailored to users' emotions and mental states. By analyzing user-generated text, preferred music genres, and physiological responses, it recommends songs that resonate with users' emotions. This AI-driven music companion can be integrated into various platforms and devices to provide users with music that complements their feelings, offering a tool for emotional regulation and relaxation.

## Background

It addresses the challenge of using music to enhance mental well-being and emotional regulation. Music has a powerful impact on our emotions, and harnessing this potential can offer significant benefits for mental health. It is a personalized AI companion that curates music playlists tailored to the user's emotions and mental state. Whether someone is feeling down, anxious, or happy, it provides music that resonates with their emotions and helps them navigate their feelings.

## How is it used?

It is designed to be a companion that users can interact with when they need emotional support or want to enhance their mood. It can be integrated into music streaming platforms, mobile apps, or wearable devices. Users can provide their emotions through voice or text input, and the AI recommends music that aligns with their feelings. The system can be beneficial for individuals seeking mood regulation, relaxation, or a musical journey to match their emotions.

## Data sources and AI methods

It relies on a diverse range of data sources, including users' preferred music genres, past listening history, physiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance), and user-generated text describing their emotions. Natural language processing is employed to analyze user text and infer emotions. Machine learning algorithms use historical listening data and emotional profiles to predict suitable songs. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, can be used to analyze album covers and predict their emotional content.


## Challenges

It is not a replacement for professional therapy or treatment. It's important to consider copyright issues when suggesting songs. The AI's emotional understanding might not always align perfectly with individual user emotions, and personal preferences can vary significantly.

## What next?

It's capabilities could expand by integrating real-time physiological data for more accurate emotion detection. Collaborations with music therapists and psychologists could lead to a more comprehensive and effective emotional music experience. Additionally, refining the AI's understanding of nuanced emotions and cultural differences could enhance the system's accuracy.

## Acknowledgments

The concept draws inspiration from existing mood-based playlist features on music streaming platforms.
